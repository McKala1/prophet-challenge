# My Mercado Libre Growth Analysis Journey with Prophet 📈🚀

### Background 🌟

* Hey everyone! It's been quite a ride diving into the world of data analysis as part of my AI bootcamp journey. Recently, I had the opportunity to step into the shoes of a growth analyst at Mercado Libre, the leading e-commerce platform in Latin America. With over 200 million users, Mercado Libre is a major player in the region's online marketplace.

### My Challenge 🎯

* The task at hand was to analyze the company's financial and user data in innovative ways to fuel its growth. I was particularly interested in exploring if the ability to predict search traffic could translate into successful stock trading strategies. Exciting, right?

### Steps I Took 📊

#### Step 1: Uncovering Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic 🧐

* First things first, I dug into the hourly Google search data for Mercado Libre, focusing on May 2020 when the company released its quarterly financial results. I spotted some intriguing spikes in search traffic during that period, hinting at possible correlations with significant financial events. I also included a graph to represent hourly search data to plot the average traffic by the day of the week. I thought this would be helpful to my analysis of the data. 

#### Step 2: Delving into Seasonality in Search Traffic Data 📅

* Next up, I delved deeper into the hourly search data to uncover any seasonal patterns of interest in the company. From hourly breakdowns to weekly and yearly trends, I identified peak traffic times, busiest days of the week, and even observed increased search activity during holiday periods.

#### Step 3: Exploring the Relationship between Search Traffic and Stock Prices 💼💡

* During a meeting with the finance team, I discussed my findings on the search traffic data and its potential connection to stock price movements. By analyzing data from the first half of 2020, I discovered intriguing similarities in trends between search traffic and stock prices. Additionally, I explored how lagged search traffic correlated with stock volatility and hourly stock returns.

#### Step 4: Building a Time Series Model with Prophet ⏰🔮

* Finally, armed with all this insightful data, I ventured into building a time series model using Prophet to forecast patterns in hourly search data. After setting up the model, I plotted forecasts and examined individual time series components to pinpoint peak popularity times, busiest search days, and lowest points in search traffic throughout the year.

### Conclusion 🌟

* This journey has been nothing short of exhilarating! From dissecting data sets to drawing meaningful insights, I've gained valuable hands-on experience that I'll carry forward in my data science career. It's amazing to see how data-driven strategies can play a pivotal role in driving growth for companies like Mercado Libre. Here's to many more exciting data adventures ahead! 🚀📊
